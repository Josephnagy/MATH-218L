    "<p> Samuel Adams was a key actor in the Revolutionary War. He originally protested the British taxation system which was imposed upon the American Colonies, for example the Stamp Act. He pushed for the colonies to unite and form a government, which happened in 1774. Adams had been actively publishing articles against the British rule, following the ideas of John Locke regarding individual freedoms. A letter, titled “Massachusetts Circular Letter” led to the boycott of British goods. The British imposition of tax on tea (known as the Tea Act), led to Adams and his underground political group, the Sons of Liberty to start ‘The Boston Tea Party’. Adams had helped spark the Revolutionary War along with his fellow agitators, and spent much of the war focusing on organising and establishing the way the new government would work.
