Pay attention to the order of the eigenvalues in $\\Sigma$ (you should order them in decreasing order) and make sure the columns of $U$ and $V$ correspond! Make sure you test your answer!\n",

Note that we are taking *outer products* between the singular vectors. Since the SVD is written in decreasing order of singular values, the later $\\sigma_i$'s are often very small compared to the earlier ones, and so those last terms contribute little to the matrix $A$. Therefore, for any $k<r$: \n",
